  description: "# Introduction\n<!-- markdownlint-disable MD029 MD033 MD034-->\n\nThe Milestone XProtect VMS has offered integration options through the MIP SDK plug-in architecture, native .NET components and libraries, and various protocols since 2011.\n\nThe Milestone Integration Platform VMS API will include RESTful APIs and other industry standard protocols that expose the functionality currently available through the MIP SDK native .NET libraries and various proprietary protocols.\n\nCurrently, the following APIs are available through the API Gateway:\n\n- RESTful APIs:\n  - <a href=\"https://doc.developer.milestonesys.com/mipvmsapi/api/config-rest/v1/\" target=\"_blank\">Configuration API</a>\n  - <a href=\"https://doc.developer.milestonesys.com/mipvmsapi/api/events-rest/v1/\" target=\"_blank\">Events API</a>\n  - <a href=\"https://doc.developer.milestonesys.com/mipvmsapi/api/alarms-rest/v1/\" target=\"_blank\">Alarms API</a>\n  - <a href=\"https://doc.developer.milestonesys.com/mipvmsapi/api/bookmarks-rest/v1/\" target=\"_blank\">Bookmarks API</a>\n  - <a href=\"https://doc.developer.milestonesys.com/mipvmsapi/api/evidencelocks-rest/v1/\" target=\"_blank\">Evidence Locks API</a>\n- WebSocket APIs:\n  - <a href=\"https://doc.developer.milestonesys.com/mipvmsapi/api/events-ws/v1/\" target=\"_blank\">Event and State API</a>\n  - <a href=\"https://doc.developer.milestonesys.com/mipvmsapi/api/messages-ws/v1/\" target=\"_blank\">Messages API</a>\n- WebRTC:\n  - Live and playback video streams from camera devices.\n\n## Intended audience\n\nYou are assumed to be somewhat familiar with XProtect VMS products, the Milestone Integration Platform (MIP), and specifically the Configuration API.\n\nYou are assumed to be somewhat familiar with RESTful APIs, specifically OpenAPI 3.\n\nTo learn more about the Milestone Integration Platform, go to the <a href=\"https://developer.milestonesys.com/s/\" target=\"_blank\">Milestone Developer Forum</a>.\n\nA comprehensive .NET Framework-based example of using the Configuration API is available at <a href=\"https://github.com/milestonesys/mipsdk-samples-component/tree/main/ConfigApiClient\" target=\"_blank\">https://github.com/milestonesys/mipsdk-samples-component/tree/main/ConfigApiClient</a>.\n\n## Support forums and support cases\n\nMilestone XProtect products are supported through the Milestone Support Community, the Milestone Developer Forum, and through a Milestone Technology Partner account.\n\n- Submit development-related questions to the <a href=\"https://developer.milestonesys.com/s/\" target=\"_blank\">Milestone Developer Forum</a>.\n- Submit installation- and configuration-related questions to the <a href=\"https://supportcommunity.milestonesys.com/s/\" target=\"_blank\">Milestone Support Community</a>\n- Create support cases on <a href=\"https://supportcommunity.milestonesys.com/s/my-cases\" target=\"_blank\">Support Community - My Cases</a>\n\nTo submit questions on the support forums, you must have a <a href=\"https://www.milestonesys.com/signup\" target=\"_blank\">Milestone account</a>.\n\nTo create support cases, you must be a <a href=\"https://www.milestonesys.com/community/become-a-partner/technology-partner-program/\" target=\"_target\">Milestone Technology Partner</a>.\n\n## Overview\n\nThe XProtect VMS offers a number of APIs to support integrations. The full functionality is currently available through a plug-in environment, native .NET libraries, and various SOAP and native protocols. XProtect VMS uses these APIs internally, and 3rd-party developers have created many integrations using these APIs. But they're not practical for integrations in a cloud environment:\n\n- The SOAP-based protocols rely on Windows Communication Framework (WCF), which is part of the .NET Framework, making it challenging to implement non-Windows integrations.\n- To use the protocols, your integration must keep track of several service endpoints.\n\nThe API Gateway simplifies protocol-based integration by providing a single entry point for all services.\n\n<!--\n```plantuml\n@startuml\nleft to right direction\nnode Client\nnode MS [\n   Management server \n   ]\nnode APIGW [\n  API Gateway\n  ]\nnode IDP [\n  Identity Provider\n  ]\nnode RS [\n  Recording server\n  ]\nnode ES [\n  Event server\n  ]\nClient -- IDP\nClient -- APIGW\nIDP -- MS\nAPIGW -- MS\nAPIGW -- RS\nAPIGW -- ES\n@enduml\n```\n-->\n![API Gateway and IDP](images/overview.png)\n\nTo use the API Gateway, a client first authenticates and requests an access token from the Identity Provider. Next, the client receives a bearer token that grants privileges to access services and perform operations as determined by the user's roles.\n\nIn subsequent requests, the client now uses the bearer token in the authorization header. The client renews the bearer token before it expires by posting a new access token request with the same credentials.\n\nThe API Gateway acts as a broker, routing requests and responses between the client and the various downstream XProtect VMS services.\n\n> User credentials, bearer tokens, and other sensitive data are transmitted in cleartext if you don't set up certificates and use HTTPS.\n\n## This release\n\n### New in XProtect VMS 2025 R2\n\n- RESTful Config API:\n  - Events for Access Control, Transact, LPR and System Monitor are now supported in alarm definitions.\n  - Tasks for applying content of another view to a view, for clearing a view, and for clearing a view item have been added to the `views` endpoint.\n  - View items returned by the `views` endpoint now contain an `id` property.\n- WebRTC:\n  - Audio streaming support has been added.\n  - The parameter `cameraId` has been replaced with the parameter `deviceId`. The `deviceId` can be either a `cameraId` or a `microphoneId`.\n  - The request object for WebSockets-based signaling has been aligned with the ONVIF protocol. The `ApiVersion` parameter is deprecated and has been replaced with `jsonrpc`. The version of `jsonrpc` has been updated from `1.0` to `2.0`.\n\n### New in XProtect VMS 2025 R1\n\n- WebRTC:\n  - In addition to the RESTful WebRTC signaling API, signaling through a WebSocket API is now supported.\n  - Executing PTZ commands through a WebRTC data channel to a connected camera is now supported.\n\n### New in XProtect VMS 2024 R2\n\n- RESTful Config API:\n  - Tasks for going to PTZ presets, activating, deactivating and triggering outputs, and getting and setting the absolute position of cameras have been added.\n  - Two endpoints for reading permissions have been added: `/securityNamespaces` and `/effectivePermissions`.\n  - The endpoint `/registeredServices` for managing registered services has been added.\n- RESTful APIs for tagging video sequences have been added:\n  - The endpoint `/bookmarks` for managing bookmarks.\n  - The endpoint `/evidenceLocks` for managing evidence locks.\n- RESTful Events API and RESTful Alarms API are no longer in beta.\n- WebSocket Messages API is no longer in beta.\n\n### New in XProtect VMS 2024 R1\n\n- Events and State WebSocket API:\n  - Updated protocol with field `inactiveTimeoutSeconds`, included with the Start Session Response message.\n  - Added Authenticate command that can be used as an alternative to the Authorization header when connecting.\n- WebRTC Playback is no longer in beta.\n\n### New in XProtect VMS 2023 R3\n\n- The API Gateway is no longer optional.  \n  At least one API Gateway must be present in an XProtect VMS site.\n- WebRTC new features:\n  - Optionally, select a specific stream when creating a WebRTC session.\n  - Playback (beta). Specify playback time, speed, and whether gaps should be skipped when creating a WebRTC session.\n  - Multiple STUN and TURN servers can now be specified in the configuration file for the API Gateway or when creating a WebRTC session.\n  - No default STUN server in the API Gateway configuration.\n  - Privacy mask prevents new WebRTC connection.\n- Event and State WebSocket API added.  \n  Use the Event and States WebSocket API to subscribe to events in the VMS. When using this API, events will be pushed to the recipient through the established WebSocket connection.\n- WebSocket Messages API (beta) added.  \n  Use the WebSocket Messages API to publish and subscribe to JSON messages in real time between Smart Client, Management Client, Event Server, and standalone services.\n  Future releases of this API might break backward compatibility\n\n### New in XProtect VMS 2023 R2\n\n- RESTful Events API (beta) and RESTful Alarms API (beta)  \n  Use the RESTful Events and Alarms APIs to retrieve stored events and trigger new events, as well as to retrieve alarms, update their priority and state, attach snapshots, and trigger new alarms. While these APIs are in beta, future releases might break backward compatibility.\n\n### New in XProtect VMS 2023 R1\n\n- Some changes to API Gateway configuration files.\n- WebRTC is enabled by default and now supports mDNS.\n\n### New in XProtect VMS 2022 R3\n\n- The API Gateway can be configured to support Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS).\n- Pre-release support for a WebRTC connection through the API Gateway. For more information, refer to sample documentation at <a href=\"https://github.com/milestonesys/mipsdk-samples-protocol/tree/main/WebRTC_JavaScript\" target=\"_blank\">WebRTC - JavaScript client</a>.\n- Syntax issues in the OpenAPI spec file have been fixed\n- The OpenAPI spec file more accurately complies with the API.\n\n### New in XProtect VMS 2022 R2\n\n- A number of syntax issues in the OpenAPI spec file have been fixed.\n- More complete coverage of the Configuration API.\n- **Breaking change**: In some parts of the RESTful API, booleans were treated as strings, meaning that the values, when provided as input, would have to be enclosed in quotation marks and returned in this form. As this doesn't comply with the JSON standard and the OpenAPI spec file we provide, we've decided to change it to `true`/`false` without quotation marks.\n\n### New in XProtect VMS 2022 R1\n\n- The API Gateway is now included in the XProtect VMS Products installer and the Administrative Installation Page.\n- The API Gateway offers a list of registered services at `/api/.well-known/uris`\n- The API Gateway now uses YARP in place of Ocelot for reverse proxy functionality\n- Logging has been added using NLog\n\n### Limitations\n\n- Only the following APIs are exposed through the API Gateway:\n  - RESTful Configuration API\n  - RESTful Alarms API\n  - RESTful Events API\n  - RESTful Bookmarks API\n  - RESTful Evidence Locks API\n  - WebSocket Event and State APIs\n  - WebSocket Messages API\n- To upgrade from the 2021 R2 pre-release of the API Gateway to a later release, you'll have to uninstall the 2021 R2 pre-release first.\n\n> To upgrade from the 2021 R2 pre-release of the API Gateway to later releases, you'll have to uninstall the 2021 R2 pre-release before upgrading.\n\n## Get started\n\nYou are recommended to set up a small separate system for development.\n\nYou should consider setting up a server certificate and using HTTPS. While the IDP, the API Gateway, and the management server can all work with either HTTP or HTTPS, production systems should be set up with server certificates.\n\n> User credentials, bearer tokens, and other sensitive data are transmitted in cleartext if you don't set up certificates and use HTTPS.\n\nThe following instructions assume that you will set up a server certificate and use HTTPS. If you choose not to create and use a server certificate, replace `https` with `http` in the following installation instructions and skip steps related to managing certificates.\n\n### Requirements\n\nTo set up a small development system, you'll need:\n\n- A Milestone account (for downloading software installers and requesting licenses)\n- An XProtect VMS Products installer (2022 R1 or later)\n- An XProtect VMS license file\n\nTo deploy the system with certificates, you'll need:\n\n- The fully qualified domain name of the development system\n- A server certificate for the development system\n\n> If you have previously installed the 2021 R2 pre-release of the API Gateway, you'll have to uninstall the pre-release before proceeding.\n\nPlease refer to <a href=\"https://www.milestonesys.com/systemrequirements/\" target=\"_blank\">Milestone product system requirements</a> for more information about system requirements.\n\n### TL;DR\n\nThis is a brief walkthrough of the installation of a simple development system with all system components on the same host.\n\n> For more information, go to <a href=\"https://doc.milestonesys.com/latest/en-US/portal/htm/chapter-page-mc-gsg.htm\" target=\"_blank\">Getting started with XProtect VMS</a>.\n\nIf you have already set up a system with XProtect VMS 2022 R1 or later, you can skip to [Verify that the API Gateway is operational](#verify-that-the-api-gateway-is-operational). Please note that you need an XProtect Basic user account with the Administrators role to run the verification scripts.\n\n<p>You can find more information about the steps in <a href=\"#notes-and-tips\">Notes and tips</a>.</p>\n\n#### Get a Milestone account\n\n1.

You can request a free 30-day trial license, or get test licenses as a Milestone Technology Partner. [Learn more](/mipvmsapi/content/dev-license).\n\n#### Create a server certificate (optional)\n\n3. Create and install a server certificate, for example, by following the instructions in <a href=\"https://doc.milestonesys.com/latest/en-US/portal/htm/chapter-page-certificates-guide.htm\" target=\"_blank\">XProtect VMS certificates guide</a>.\n\n   - When prompted for DNS names, include the fully qualified domain name for the server.\n\n#### Install XProtect VMS\n\n4. Download an XProtect VMS Products installer from the <a href=\"https://www.milestonesys.com/support/resources/download-software/?prod=3&type=11\" target=\"_blank\">software download</a> page.\n\n5. Install XProtect VMS:\n   - When you get to the **Select an installation type** page, select **Single computer**.\n   - When you get to the **Select encryption** page, enable **Server certificate** and select the `VMS SSL Certificate` you just created and installed in step 1.\n   - When you get to the **Add users** page, add a Basic user with the Administrators role, for example, user `seamrune` and password `Rad23Swops#`.\n\n#### Verify that the API Gateway is operational\n\n<!-- https://{{mshost}}/idp/.well-known/openid-configuration might also be interesting/relevant, no authentication needed -->\n\n6. Verify that you can get a list of well-known URIs from the API Gateway:\n\n   cURL\n\n   ```shell cURL\n   curl --insecure --request GET \"https://test-01.example.com/api/.well-known/uris\"\n   ```\n\n   PowerShell\n\n   ```powershell\n   $response = Invoke-RestMethod 'https://test-01.example.com/api/.well-known/uris' -Method 'GET'\n   $response | ConvertTo-Json\n   ```\n\n   Response body\n\n  ```json\n  {\n    \"ProductVersion\": \"22.1.5804.1\",\n    \"UnsecureManagementServer\": \"http://test-01.example.com/\",\n    \"SecureManagementServer\": \"https://test-01.example.com/\",\n    \"IdentityProvider\": \"https://test-01.example.com/IDP\",\n    \"ApiGateways\": [\n        \"https://test-01.example.com/API/\"\n    ]\n  }  \n  ```\n\n> In case you had installed an API Gateway on another host, you could use the hostname of that host.\n\n7. Verify that you can authenticate and retrieve a bearer token from the built-in IDP.\n\n   Replace the hostname `test-01.example.com`, username `seamrune`, and password `Rad23Swops#` in the following code samples. In Windows Command Prompt (CMD), replace the line continuation character `\\` with `^`.\n\n   cURL\n\n   ```shell cURL\n   curl --insecure --request POST \"https://test-01.example.com/API/IDP/connect/token\" \\\n   --header \"Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded\" \\\n   --data-urlencode \"grant_type=password\" \\\n   --data-urlencode \"username=seamrune\" \\\n   --data-urlencode \"password=Rad23Swops#\" \\\n   --data-urlencode \"client_id=GrantValidatorClient\"\n   ```\n\n   PowerShell\n\n   ```powershell\n   $headers = @{ \"Content-Type\" = \"application/x-www-form-urlencoded\" }\n   $body = @{grant_type='password'\n       username='seamrune'\n       password='Rad23Swops#'\n       client_id='GrantValidatorClient'}\n   $response = Invoke-RestMethod 'https://test-01.example.com/API/IDP/connect/token' -Method 'POST' -Headers $headers -Body $body\n   $response | ConvertTo-Json\n   ```\n\n   Response body\n\n   ```json\n   {\n    \"access_token\": \"eyJhbGciOiJodHRwOi8vd3d3LnczLm9yZy8yMDAxLzA0L . . . ay0ferTwm-DZ4OxNXGTHk5t7R_YTWPjg\",\n    \"expires_in\": 3600,\n    \"token_type\": \"Bearer\",\n    \"scope\": \"managementserver\"\n   }\n   ```\n\n   Copy the `access_token` value from the response body; you will use the value as the bearer token value in the following request.\n\n8. Verify that you can submit a request through the API Gateway.\n\n   Replace the hostname `test-01.example.com` and the bearer token value `eyJhbG . . . YTWPjg` in the following code samples. In Windows Command Prompt (CMD), replace the line continuation character `\\` with `^`.\n\n   cURL\n\n   ```shell cURL\n   curl --insecure --request GET \"https://test-01.example.com/api/rest/v1/sites\" \\\n   --header \"Authorization: Bearer eyJhbGciOiJodHRwOi8vd3d3LnczLm9yZy8yMDAxLzA0L . . . ay0ferTwm-DZ4OxNXGTHk5t7R_YTWPjg\"\n   ```\n\n   PowerShell\n\n   ```PowerShell\n   $headers = @{ \"Authorization\" = \"Bearer eyJhbGciOiJodHRwOi8vd3d3LnczLm9yZy8yMDAxLzA0L . . . ay0ferTwm-DZ4OxNXGTHk5t7R_YTWPjg\" }\n   $response = Invoke-RestMethod 'https://test-01.example.com/api/rest/v1/sites' -Method 'GET' -Headers $headers\n   $response | ConvertTo-Json\n   ```\n\n   Response body\n\n   ```json\n   {\n     \"array\": [\n       {\n         \"displayName\": \"TEST-01\",\n         \"id\": \"2d12465c-3485-4ca8-a9fb-86a79de1a82f\",\n         \"name\": \"TEST-01\",\n         \"description\": \"\",\n         \"lastModified\": \"2021-11-11T11:11:11.1111111Z\",\n         \"timeZone\": \"Central Europe Time\",\n         \"computerName\": \"TEST-01\",\n         \"domainName\": \"example.com\",\n         \"lastStatusHandshake\": \"2021-11-11T11:11:11.1111111Z\",\n         \"physicalMemory\": 0,\n         \"platform\": \"[Not Available]\",\n         \"processors\": 0,\n         \"serviceAccount\": \"S-1-5-20\",\n         \"synchronizationStatus\": 0,\n         \"masterSiteAddress\": \"\",\n         \"version\": \"22.1.0.1\",\n         \"relations\": {\n           \"self\": {\n             \"type\": \"sites\",\n             \"id\": \"2d12465c-3485-4ca8-a9fb-86a79de1a82f\"\n           }\n         }\n       }\n     ]\n   }\n   ```\n\n### Notes and tips\n\n#### XProtect VMS license\n\nTo determine which XProtect VMS product license you need, please visit <a href=\"https://www.milestonesys.com/products/software/xprotect-comparison/\" target=\"_blank\">Milestone product index</a>.\n\nYou can get a license in several ways:\n\n- Go to <a href=\"https://www.milestonesys.com/products/software/try-xprotect/\" target=\"_blank\">Select the Milestone XProtect® variant you would like to try</a>. You will be mailed a trial license for the selected product.\n- XProtect VMS test licenses are available for XProtect Technology Partners. Join the Milestone Technology Partner Program at <a href=\"https://www.milestonesys.com/partners/become-a-partner/technology-partner/\" target=\"_blank\">Join our technology partner program</a>.\n\n#### Creating an XProtect Basic user\n\nAfter installation, you can use the **XProtect Management Client** to create XProtect Basic and Windows users.\n\nFor more information, go to <a href=\"https://doc.milestonesys.com/latest/en-US/standard_features/sf_mc/sf_mcnodes/sf_6security/mc_createbasicusers.htm\" target=\"_blank\">XProtect VMS administrator manual/Create basic user</a>.\n\n#### Setting up Postman to handle certificates\n\nPostman doesn't use the certificate store on your platform. To work with secure services, you have two options:\n\n- Disable certificate verification in Postman\n- Add the CA certificate used to sign the VMS server certificate\n\nFor more information, see [Encryption, SSL/TLS, and Managing Your Certificates in Postman](https://blog.postman.com/encryption-ssl-tls-and-managing-your-certificates-in-postman/).\n\n##### Disable certificate verification in Postman\n\n1. Open Postman, then select **File** > **Settings**\n2. In the **Settings** dialog, select the **General** tab.\n3. Move the slider for **SSL certificate verification** to the OFF position.\n\nWith certificate verification disabled, Postman makes no attempt to verify the connection.\n\n##### Add the CA certificate used to sign the VMS server certificate\n\nFor Postman, the CA certificate needs to be in PEM format. A PEM file is a collection of Base-64 encoded certificates contained within a single file. As long as the CA certificate is exported in Base-64 encoded format, Postman will accept a `.cer` file.\n\nThe following instructions assume that you have set up your own CA certificate as described in <a href=\"https://doc.milestonesys.com/latest/en-US/portal/htm/chapter-page-certificates-guide.htm\" target=\"_blank\">XProtect VMS certificates guide</a> and that you have the CA certificate installed on a Windows platform. Adjust as necessary for other CA certificates and platforms.\n\n1. Start the Local Computer certificates manager, for example, by running `certlm.msc`.\n2. Select **Trusted Root Certification Authorities** > **Certificates**\n3. Select the **VMS Certificate Authority**, then right-click and select **All Tasks** > **Export...**.\n4. Within the Certificate Export Wizard dialog:\n   1. Select **Next** on the Welcome screen.\n   2. Select **Base-64 encoded X.509 (.CER)** on the **Export File Format** screen, and select **Next**.\n   3. Enter a path and filename to save the certificate on the **File To Export** screen, and select **Next**.\n   4. Select **Finish** to complete the wizard and save the certificate.\n5. Copy the exported certificate file to the machine you are running Postman on.\n6. Open Postman, then select **File** > **Settings**.\n7. In the **Settings** dialog, select the **Certificates** tab.\n8. Within the **CA Certificates** section, move the slider to the ON position, click **Select File**, then select the Base-64 encoded CA certificate file exported earlier.\n\n## Download OpenAPI specification\n\nDownload the OpenAPI specification for the Configuration API from <a href=\"openapi.yaml\" download=\"openapi.yaml\" target=\"_blank\">https://doc.developer.milestonesys.com/mipvmsapi/api/config-rest/v1/openapi.yaml</a>.\n\n## Samples\n\nSimple code samples are available at [Milestone System's GitHub](https://github.com/milestonesys) page.\n\n### Using RESTful APIs\n\n- [ProtocolSamples/RestfulCommunicationPython](https://github.com/milestonesys/mipsdk-samples-protocol/tree/main/RestfulCommunicationPython): RESTful Config API - Python.\n- [ComponentSamples/RestfulCommunication](https://github.com/milestonesys/mipsdk-samples-component/tree/main/RestfulCommunication): RESTful Config API - MIP .NET.\n- [ProtocolSamples/AlarmsRestApiPython](https://github.com/milestonesys/mipsdk-samples-protocol/tree/main/AlarmsRestApiPython): RESTful Alarms API - Python.\n- [ProtocolSamples/EventsRestApiPython](https://github.com/milestonesys/mipsdk-samples-protocol/tree/main/EventsRestApiPython): RESTful Events API - Python.\n\n### Using WebSocket APIs\n\n- [ProtocolSamples/EventsAndStateWebSocketApiPython](https://github.com/milestonesys/mipsdk-samples-protocol/tree/main/EventsAndStateWebSocketApiPython):  WebSocket Event and State API - Python.\n- [ComponentSamples/EventAndStateViewer](https://github.com/milestonesys/mipsdk-samples-component/tree/main/EventAndStateViewer): WebSocket Event and State API - MIP .NET\n- [PluginSamples/ChatWithWebsockets](https://github.com/milestonesys/mipsdk-samples-plugin/tree/main/ChatWithWebsockets): Chat with WebSocket Messages API - MIP plug-in.\n- [ProtocolSamples/ChatWithWebsockets](https://github.com/milestonesys/mipsdk-samples-protocol/tree/main/ChatWithWebsockets): Chat with WebSocket Messages API - JavaScript.\n\n### Using WebRTC\n\n- [ProtocolSamples/WebRTC_JavaScript](https://github.com/milestonesys/mipsdk-samples-protocol/tree/main/WebRTC_JavaScript) and [ProtocolSamples/WebRTC_.NET](https://github.com/milestonesys/mipsdk-samples-protocol/tree/main/WebRTC_.NET): Use either a RESTful API or a WebSocket API for the signaling required to establish a WebRTC connection with an XProtect VMS through the API Gateway.\n\n## Configuration files\n\nAPI Gateway configuration files are located in the installation location, by default `%ProgramFiles%\\Milestone\\XProtect API Gateway\\`.\n\nThese configuration files are relevant for the API Gateway:\n\n- `appsettings.Production.json`: Overrides the configuration settings in `appsettings.json`.\n- `appsettings.json`: Reverse proxy (routing), CORS, WebRTC, log levels, etc.\n- `nlog.config`: Log layout, log targets, etc.\n\n### Editing configuration files\n\n> Use a validating editor to edit configuration files. Most popular code editors support JSON and XML syntax validation, either by default or through extensions.\n\nSyntax errors in the API Gateway configurations files result in `502 Bad Gateway` or `503 Service Unavailable` server errors and will show up in the Windows Application event log and the IIS request log.\n\n### appsettings.json and appsettings.Production.json\n\n> Don't edit the `appsettings.json` file manually. The configuration is created by the XProtect product installer and maintained by the **Server Configurator**.\n\nIf you need to override a configuration setting in `appsettings.json`, create `appsettings.Production.json` and add configuration overrides here. `appsettings.Production.json` won't be removed or changed by product updates.\n\nIn `appsettings.Production.json`, include only the properties that you need to override. You will probably only need some of these top-level properties:\n\n- `Logging`\n- `CORS`\n- `WebRTC`\n\nIf already present in `appsettings.json`, you can copy the complete top-level property from `appsettings.json` to `appsettings.Production.json` and remove the nested properties that you don't want to change.\n\nFor example, to change the logging level for YARP but no other `Logging` settings, include this in `appsettings.Production.json`:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"Logging\": {\n    \"LogLevel\": {\n      \"Yarp\": \"Information\"\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\nIf you add several properties to `appsettings.Production.json`, remember to include a comma *between* the properties but no trailing comma:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"Logging\": {\n    \"LogLevel\": {\n      \"Yarp\": \"Information\"\n    }\n  },\n  \"CORS\": {\n    \"Enabled\": true,\n    \"Access-Control-Allow-Origin\": \"yourdomain1.com,yourdomain2.com\",\n    \"Access-Control-Allow-Headers\": \"*\",\n    \"Access-Control-Allow-Methods\": \"*\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### Reverse proxy\n\nThe reverse proxy functionality of the API Gateway is implemented using **YARP**.\n\nThe `ReverseProxy` section in `appsettings.json` is related to the reverse proxy functionality. The configuration is created by the product installer and maintained by the **Server Configurator**.\n\nFor more information about YARP, please refer to [YARP: Yet Another Reverse Proxy](https://microsoft.github.io/reverse-proxy/index.html).\n\n### Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS)\n\nThe API Gateway can be configured to support Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS). The following response headers are supported:\n\n- [`Access-Control-Allow-Origin`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Access-Control-Allow-Origin)\n- [`Access-Control-Allow-Headers`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Access-Control-Allow-Headers)\n- [`Access-Control-Allow-Methods`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Access-Control-Allow-Methods)\n\nCORS is disabled by default. You enable and configure CORS support by creating and editing `appsettings.Production.json`.\n\n1. Create `appsettings.Production.json` (if not already created).\n2. Enable and configure CORS response headers similar to this:\n\n   ```json\n   {\n     \"CORS\": {\n       \"Enabled\": true,\n       \"Access-Control-Allow-Origin\": \"yourdomain1.com,yourdomain2.com\",\n       \"Access-Control-Allow-Headers\": \"*\",\n       \"Access-Control-Allow-Methods\": \"*\"\n     }\n   }\n   ```\n\n3. Restart the IIS, or at least recycle `VideoOS ApiGateway AppPool`.\n\nOnly required response headers should be defined. Each response header can have multiple values, provided as a list of comma-separated values.\n\n> In a production system, always specify the `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` value with explicit origins. Never use wildcard (*) or null in your origin as this can put the security of your system at risk.\n\nFor development and test purposes, you can use a very permissive policy:\n\n```json\n  {\n\_\_  \"CORS\": {\n\_\_\_\_  \"Enabled\": true,\n\_\_\_\_  \"Access-Control-Allow-Origin\": \"*\",\n\_\_\_\_  \"Access-Control-Allow-Headers\": \"*\",\n\_\_\_\_  \"Access-Control-Allow-Methods\": \"*\"\n\_\_  }\n  }\n```\n\nThis will allow calls from any origin, including a local file system, to the API Gateway.\n\nFor more information about CORS, please refer to [Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CORS)\n\n### WebRTC\n\nWebRTC is a peer-to-peer protocol for streaming data, such as video.\n\n#### Default STUN and TURN server addresses\n\nTo help establish a connection through NATs, WebRTC uses STUN (Session Traversal Utilities for NAT) and/or TURN (Traversal Using Relays around NAT) servers.\n\nA STUN server is used to discover the public IP address and port number of a device behind a NAT.\n\nA TURN server is used to relay traffic between peers when a direct connection is impossible due to firewall or NAT restrictions. TURN servers can also act as STUN servers.\n\nNo default STUN or TURN server URLs are configured API Gateway-side.\n\nYou can configure default STUN and TURN servers to be used in sessions that don't supply servers through Session options.\n\n> **No username and credential setting**\n> The `appsettings.production.json` file can't be used for a TURN server that requires username and credential as the file isn't a safe location to store credentials.\n\nTo specify default STUN and/or TURN servers:\n\n1. Create `appsettings.Production.json` (if not already created).\n2. Add a WebRTC object and add STUN and TURN server URLs, for example:\n\n   ```json\n   {\n     \"WebRTC\": {\n       \"iceServers\": [ \n         { \"url\": \"stun:mystun.zyx:3478\"}, \n         { \"url\": \"turn:myturn.zyx:5349\"} \n       ] \n     }\n   }\n   ```\n\n3. Restart the IIS, or at least recycle `VideoOS ApiGateway AppPool`.\n\nFor more information about WebRTC, please refer to [WebRTC API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebRTC_API) and the WebRTC sample documentation at [ProtocolSamples/WebRTC_JavaScript](https://github.com/milestonesys/mipsdk-samples-protocol/tree/main/WebRTC_JavaScript)\n\n### Logging\n\nThe API Gateway uses NLog for logging.\n\nLogging is configured in two places:\n\n- `appsettings.json` and `appsettings.Production.json`: Log levels\n- `nlog.config`: Log layout, target, etc.\n\n#### Log levels\n\nThis part of `appsettings.json` is related to logging:\n\n```json\n  \"Logging\": {\n    \"LogLevel\": {\n      \"Default\": \"Information\",\n      \"Microsoft\": \"Warning\",\n      \"Microsoft.Hosting.Lifetime\": \"Information\",\n      \"Yarp\": \"Warning\"\n    }\n```\n\nTo include YARP routing log messages, add a log level setting in `appsettings.production.json` for `Yarp`, for example, `Information`:\n\n1. Create `appsettings.Production.json` (if not already created).\n2. Add the configuration that you want to override, for example:\n\n   ```json\n   {\n   \_\_\"Logging\": {\n   \_\_\_\_\"LogLevel\": {\n   \_\_\_\_\_\_\"Yarp\": \"Information\"\n   \_\_\_\_}\n   \_\_}\n   }\n   ```\n\n3. Restart the IIS, or at least recycle `VideoOS ApiGateway AppPool`.\n\n#### Log layout, log targets, etc\n\nThis is the default NLog configuration file:\n\n```xml\n<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?>\n<nlog xmlns=\"http://www.nlog-project.org/schemas/NLog.xsd\"\n  xmlns:xsi=\"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance\"\n  autoReload=\"true\"\n  internalLogLevel=\"Warn\"\n  internalLogFile=\"internal-nlog.txt\">\n  <variable\n    name=\"logDirectory\"\n     value=\"C:\\ProgramData\\Milestone\\ApiGateway\\Logs\" />\n  <variable\n    name=\"archiveDirectory\"\n   value=\"${var:logDirectory}\\Archive\" />\n  <variable\n    name=\"defaultLayout\" \n    value=\"${date:format=yyyy-MM-dd HH\\:mm\\:ss.fffzzz} [${threadid:padding=6}] ${level:uppercase=true:padding=-10} - ${message} ${exception:format=tostring}\" />\n  <targets>\n    <target\n      name=\"logfile\"\n      xsi:type=\"File\"\n      fileName=\"${var:logDirectory}\\gateway.log\"\n      archiveFileName=\"${var:archiveDirectory}\\gateway-{####}.log\"\n      archiveNumbering=\"Rolling\"\n      maxArchiveFiles=\"20\"\n      archiveEvery=\"Day\"\n      archiveAboveSize=\"1000000\"\n      archiveOldFileOnStartup=\"true\"\n      createDirs=\"true\"\n      layout=\"${var:defaultLayout}\" />\n  </targets>\n  <rules>\n    <logger name=\"*\" minlevel=\"Debug\" writeTo=\"logfile\" />\n  </rules>\n</nlog>\n```\n\nFor more information about NLog configuration, please refer to [NLog Configuration options](https://nlog-project.org/config).\n\n## Authentication and authorization\n\nFor authentication and authorization, the API Gateway can use\n\n- XProtect Basic user authentication, available through OpenID Connect and OAuth 2.0 Identity Provider (IDP) endpoints\n- XProtect Windows user authentication, available through a Milestone .NET Framework library\n\nAuthorization is based on OAuth2 bearer tokens.\n\nAn internal IDP endpoint is provided with the XProtect VMS management server. Either the internal IDP or an external IDP can be used.\n\nFor more information about using external IDPs with XProtect VMS, please refer to [XProtect VMS administrator manual/Authentication/External IDP (explained)](https://doc.milestonesys.com/latest/en-US/standard_features/sf_mc/sf_systemoverview/mc_external_idpexplained.htm).\n\n> XProtect Basic user authentication through the IDP is **not** based on HTTP Basic authentication\n\n## API usage\n\n### Notation\n\n#### Root entry points\n\nThe API Gateway exposes a list of relevant server and API Gateway URIs at this URI:\n\n- `/api/.well-known/uris`\n\nRESTful APIs are exposed at this root entry point:\n\n- `/api/rest/v1`\n\nWebSocket APIs are exposed at these root entry points:\n\n- `/api/ws/alarms/v1`\n- `/api/ws/events/v1`\n- `/api/ws/messages/v1`\n\nA complete request URI includes scheme, hostname, root entry point, endpoint route, and optionally query parameters, for example:\n\n```http\nhttps://test-01.example.com/api/rest/v1/recordingservers/b1c84b2c-47a9-48aa-b7d5-ee43167b30da?resources\n```\n\nIn this document, the `https://test-01.example.com/api/rest/v1` part is omitted from request URIs. Only endpoint and query parameters are included:\n\n```http\n/recordingservers/b1c84b2c-47a9-48aa-b7d5-ee43167b30da?resources\n```\n\n#### Syntax examples\n\nA complete dump of a simple request and response might look like this:\n\n```http\nGET /api/rest/v1/sites HTTP/1.1\nAuthorization: Bearer eyJhbGciOiJSUzI1NiIsImtpZCI6IjBhYWI3ZGU2YzExN . . .

Also, each object contains a `relations` element with relevant links to itself, parent, or related objects.\n\n### Object model\n\nThe top-level object name is `data` for the requested data or `array` if the requested data is an array of data.\n\nFor example, the collection of `hardware` objects is represented as an `array`:\n\n```http\nGET /hardware\n```\n\n```json\n{\n    \"array\": [\n        {\n            \"displayName\": \"AXIS P5522 PTZ Dome Network Camera (10.100.50.129)\",\n            \"enabled\": \"True\",\n            \"id\": \"149d6f4d-4f71-4ced-98b4-8b1e914578db\",\n            \"name\": \"AXIS P5522 PTZ Dome Network Camera (10.100.50.129)\",\n            \"description\": \"\",\n            \"address\": \"http://10.100.50.129/\",\n            \"userName\": \"root\",\n            \"model\": \"AXIS P5522 PTZ Dome Network Camera\",\n            \"lastModified\": \"2022-01-19T07:58:28.3170000Z\",\n            \"hardwareDriverPath\": {\n                \"type\": \"hardwareDrivers\",\n                \"id\": \"316f4995-decd-4fa9-9877-0833b369c053\"\n            },\n            \"relations\": {\n                \"parent\": {\n                    \"type\": \"recordingServers\",\n                    \"id\": \"b1c84b2c-47a9-48aa-b7d5-ee43167b30da\"\n                },\n                \"self\": {\n                    \"type\": \"hardware\",\n                    \"id\": \"149d6f4d-4f71-4ced-98b4-8b1e914578db\"\n                }\n            }\n        },\n        {\n            \"displayName\": \"AXIS M1144-L Network Camera (10.100.50.187)\",\n            \"enabled\": \"True\",\n            \"id\": \"4d7a1e6a-b538-482f-9ce0-e44048cb5955\",\n            \"name\": \"AXIS M1144-L Network Camera (10.100.50.187)\",\n            \"description\": \"\",\n            \"address\": \"http://10.100.50.187/\",\n            \"userName\": \"root\",\n            \"model\": \"AXIS M1144-L Network Camera\",\n            \"lastModified\": \"2022-01-19T07:58:29.6130000Z\",\n            \"hardwareDriverPath\": {\n                \"type\": \"hardwareDrivers\",\n                \"id\": \"316f4995-decd-4fa9-9877-0833b369c053\"\n            },\n            \"relations\": {\n                \"parent\": {\n                    \"type\": \"recordingServers\",\n                    \"id\": \"b1c84b2c-47a9-48aa-b7d5-ee43167b30da\"\n                },\n                \"self\": {\n                    \"type\": \"hardware\",\n                    \"id\": \"4d7a1e6a-b538-482f-9ce0-e44048cb5955\"\n                }\n            }\n        },\n        // more hardware objects related to this recording server\n    ]\n}\n```\n\nA single object is addressed by its type and ID:\n\n```http\nGET /hardware/149d6f4d-4f71-4ced-98b4-8b1e914578db\n```\n\n```json\n{\n    \"data\": {\n        \"displayName\": \"AXIS P5522 PTZ Dome Network Camera (10.100.50.129)\",\n        \"enabled\": \"True\",\n        \"id\": \"149d6f4d-4f71-4ced-98b4-8b1e914578db\",\n        \"name\": \"AXIS P5522 PTZ Dome Network Camera (10.100.50.129)\",\n        \"description\": \"\",\n        \"address\": \"http://10.100.50.129/\",\n        \"userName\": \"root\",\n        \"model\": \"AXIS P5522 PTZ Dome Network Camera\",\n        \"lastModified\": \"2022-01-19T07:58:28.3170000Z\",\n        \"hardwareDriverPath\": {\n            \"type\": \"hardwareDrivers\",\n            \"id\": \"316f4995-decd-4fa9-9877-0833b369c053\"\n        },\n        \"relations\": {\n            \"parent\": {\n                \"type\": \"recordingServers\",\n                \"id\": \"b1c84b2c-47a9-48aa-b7d5-ee43167b30da\"\n            },\n            \"self\": {\n                \"type\": \"hardware\",\n                \"id\": \"149d6f4d-4f71-4ced-98b4-8b1e914578db\"\n            }\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### Resource URIs\n\nThe object that represents the configuration of the management server itself has this URI:\n\n```http\n/sites\n```\n\nAlmost any other object will have a format like these:\n\n```http\n/recordingServers/{id}\n/hardware/{id}\n/cameras/{id}\n```\n\nFor objects that are parented by another object, the resource URI grows to:\n\n```http\n/recordingServers/{id}/hardwareDrivers/{id2}\n/cameras/{id}/ptzPresets/{id2}\n```\n\nThere are never more than two levels in resource URIs. A resource with only one instance will re-use the ID of its parent. For example, there is only one `streams` collection for each camera, and the camera ID is re-used for the streams related to the camera:\n\n```http\nGET /streams/{camera-id}\n```\n\nSee also [Operations on objects](#operations-on-objects)\n\n### Request query parameters\n\nThe following query parameters can be added to a request URI:\n\n- `disabled` : include disabled objects\n- `resources` : get a list of child resources to an object\n- `task`: specify a task to invoke like this: `?task={someTaskId}`\n- `tasks`: get a list of valid tasks for an object\n- `noData` : suppress data in the response\n- `definitions`: get definition of object (including task) parameters\n- `language` : get all translations for a given language\n\nThe `language` parameter is only relevant for the `translations` resource. The other parameters can be combined.\n\n#### disabled parameter\n\nBy default, only enabled objects will be included in the response.\n\nTo include all disabled objects in the response, include the query parameter `disabled` like this:\n\n```http\nGET /cameras?disabled\n```\n\n#### resources parameter\n\nTo find out which resource types are available for a specific object, include the query parameter `resources` like this:\n\n```http\nGET /recordingServers/{id}?resources\n```\n\nThe response body will contain an array of all the child resource types available for the requested resource:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"data\": {\n        // properties for this recording server object\n    },\n    \"resources\": [\n        {\n            \"type\": \"hardware\",\n            \"displayName\": \"Hardware\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"type\": \"hardwareDrivers\",\n            \"displayName\": \"Drivers\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"type\": \"storages\",\n            \"displayName\": \"Storages\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"type\": \"recordingServerMulticasts\",\n            \"displayName\": \"Multicasts\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"type\": \"recordingServerFailovers\",\n            \"displayName\": \"Failover\"\n        }\n    ]\n}\n```\n\nTo get an array of child objects, append the resource `type` value to the specific parent resource route like this:\n\n```http\nGET /recordingServers/{id}/storages\n```\n\nFor objects that don't have any child resources, the response will contain an empty array:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"resources\": []\n}\n```\n\n#### tasks parameter\n\nTo get an array of tasks available for a given resource, use the query parameter `tasks` like this:\n\n```http\nGET /hardware/{id}?tasks\n```\n\n```json\n{\n    \"data\": {\n        // properties for this hardware object\n    },\n    \"tasks\": [\n        {\n            \"id\": \"ReadPasswordHardware\",\n            \"displayName\": \"Read hardware password\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"ChangePasswordHardware\",\n            \"displayName\": \"Change hardware password\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"UpdateFirmwareHardware\",\n            \"displayName\": \"Update firmware\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"MoveHardware\",\n            \"displayName\": \"Move hardware\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"UpdateHardware\",\n            \"displayName\": \"Update hardware\"\n        }\n    ]\n}\n```\n\nThe task `id` can then be used to invoke a task.\n\nSee also [task parameter](#task-parameter) and [Tasks](#tasks)\n\n#### task parameter\n\nTo invoke a task on a resource, specify the task as the value of the query parameter `task` in a `POST` request like this:\n\n```http\nPOST /hardware/{id}?task=MoveHardware\n```\n\nProvide parameters to the request in the request body. If the body doesn't contain the required parameters, the response will contain an `error` object and a `params` object listing the required parameters:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"error\": {\n        \"httpCode\": 400,\n        \"details\": [\n            {\n                \"errorText\": \"Bad request: parameters missing\"\n            }\n        ]\n    },\n    \"params\": {\n        \"destinationRecordingServer\": \"\"\n    }\n}\n```\n\nTo understand the parameters in detail, add the query parameter `definitions` to either a `GET` or `POST` query like this:\n\n```http\nPOST /hardware/{id}?task=MoveHardware&definitions\n```\n\nThe response will include a list of definitions for each of the parameters like this:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"error\": {\n        \"httpCode\": 400,\n        \"details\": [\n            {\n                \"errorText\": \"Bad request: parameters missing\"\n            }\n        ]\n    },\n    \"params\": {\n        \"destinationRecordingServer\": \"\"\n    },\n    \"definitions\": {\n        \"displayName\": {\n            \"canSet\": \"false\",\n            \"translationId\": \"PropertyDisplayName\"\n        },\n        \"destinationRecordingServer\": {\n            \"canSet\": \"true\",\n            \"options\": [\n                {\n                    \"value\": \"recordingServers/c9cef804-e600-4b4b-b5f9-be246bb49133\",\n                    \"displayName\": \"My recording server\"\n                },\n                {\n                    \"value\": \"recordingServers/b1c84b2c-47a9-48aa-b7d5-ee43167b30da\",\n                    \"displayName\": \"My other recording server\"\n                }\n            ],\n            \"valueType\": \"enum\",\n            \"translationId\": \"PropertyHardwareDestinationRecorder\",\n            \"toolTipTranslationId\": \"PropertyHardwareDestinationRecorderToolTip\"\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\nAdd the required parameter value to the request body, and submit the request again:\n\n```json\nPOST /hardware/{id}?task=MoveHardware\n\n{\n    \"destinationRecordingServer\": \"recordingServers/c9cef804-e600-4b4b-b5f9-be246bb49133\"\n}\n```\n\nSee also [Task invocation](#task-invocation)\n\n#### noData parameter\n\nAdd the query parameter `noData` to suppress `data` content in the response. Can be used when other query parameters are present, e.g. `resources` or `tasks`.\n\n#### language parameter\n\n<!-- how to know which languages are available? -->\n\nThe `translations` collection represents the translation of display names for parameters. Add the `language` query parameter to specify the language:\n\n```http\nGET /translations?language=tr-TR\n```\n\nThe response body contains an array of translated display names for the specified language:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"array\": [\n        {\n            \"id\": \"PropertyLicenseActivationAutomatic\",\n            \"text\": \"Enable automatic license activation\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"PropertyCameraGroupPaths\",\n            \"text\": \"Camera group paths\"\n        },\n        // and 6000 more entries here\n    ]\n}\n```\n\n> **Note**: Translations aren't yet supported, and it will return English for now.\n\n#### definitions parameter\n\nAdd the query parameter `definitions` to request the definition for each property of an object. Most of the properties use enumerations or numbers within a defined range.\n\nThe following example is from the `hardwareDriverSettings` resource on an Axis hardware:\n\n```http\nGET /hardwareDriverSettings/3954fd12-a071-4464-89d3-d8147ff8a4c5?definitions\n```\n\n```json\n{\n    \"data\": {\n        \"displayName\": \"Settings\",\n        \"HardwareDriverSettings\": {\n            \"displayName\": \"General\",\n            \"detectedModelName\": \"AXIS Q1647 Network Camera\",\n            // ...\n            \"bandwidth\": \"Unlimited\",\n            // ...\n            \"brightness\": \"50\",\n            // ...\n            \"whiteBalance\": \"Fixed indoor\",\n            // ...\n            \"auxUse\": \"Wiper\",\n            // ...\n        }\n    },\n    \"definitions\": {\n        \"HardwareDriverSettings\": {\n            \"detectedModelName\": {\n                \"canSet\": \"false\",\n                \"translationId\": \"a57d4e50-4158-4d04-955a-3141653e44dc\"\n            },\n            // ...\n            \"bandwidth\": {\n                \"canSet\": \"true\",\n                \"valueType\": \"enum\",\n                \"options\": {\n                    \"Unlimited\": \"Unlimited\",\n                    \"4 Mbit\": \"4 Mbit\",\n                    \"2 Mbit\": \"2 Mbit\",\n                    \"1 Mbit\": \"1 Mbit\",\n                    \"768 Kbit\": \"768 Kbit\",\n                    \"512 Kbit\": \"512 Kbit\",\n                    \"256 Kbit\": \"256 Kbit\",\n                    \"128 Kbit\": \"128 Kbit\",\n                    \"64 Kbit\": \"64 Kbit\"\n                },\n                \"translationId\": \"3379b746-444c-4fdc-8447-8e7215cdb1e7\"\n            },\n            \"audioEncoding\": {\n                \"canSet\": \"true\",\n                \"valueType\": \"enum\",\n                \"options\": {\n                    \"G711\": \"G.711\",\n                    \"G726-32\": \"G.726 32 kbit/s\",\n                    \"G726-24\": \"G.726 24 kbit/s\",\n                    \"AAC\": \"AAC\"\n                },\n                \"translationId\": \"1d0b927a-ac2d-4fba-98bc-fcc05c2dbd4a\"\n            },\n            // ...\n            \"brightness\": {\n                \"canSet\": \"true\",\n                \"valueType\": \"slider\",\n                \"MinValue\": \"0\",\n                \"MaxValue\": \"100\",\n                \"StepValue\": \"1\",\n                \"translationId\": \"96cbdf37-4ffc-46d8-89d0-d24ece0b4fb7\"\n            },\n            // ...\n            \"auxUse\": {\n                \"canSet\": \"true\",\n                \"valueType\": \"enum\",\n                \"options\": {\n                    \"PTZ\": \"PTZ Movement\",\n                    \"Wiper\": \"Wiper/Washer Control\"\n                },\n                \"translationId\": \"b3ebed61-8e59-45f5-963d-1f271c1e5a0d\"\n            },\n            // ...\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\nIn this example, the property `auxUse` has a current value of `Wiper`. In the definitions section, the `auxUse` property is defined as an enumeration with two values: `PTZ` or `Wiper`.\n\nEach property is defined in terms of:\n\n- `canSet` – boolean, `true` when this property can be changed\n- `valueType` – `enum`, `int`, `double`, `slider`, `bool`, `string`, `dateTime`, `date`, `time`, `path`, `pathList`, `progress`, `list`, `array`\n- `options` – used for enums to list the set of values\n- `translationId` – id for display name in the translation array\n- `minValue` – lowest valid value for an `int`, `double` or `slider`\n- `maxValue` – highest valid value for an `int`, `double` or `slider`\n- `stepValue` – minimum interval on a `slider`, e.g. `5` would mean that `0`, `5`, `10`, `15` etc are valid\n\n### Filters and pagination\n\n#### Filters\n\nYou can add match filters to a resource URI to limit the amount of data returned.\n\nFor example, to return only hardware of specific model, include a filter like this:\n\n```http\nGET /hardware?model='AXIS Q1725'\n```\n\nWhen no filter operator is included, the property value must match exactly.\n\nTo exclude specific objects, use the `notEquals` operator like this:\n\n```http\nGET /hardware?model=notEquals:'AXIS Q1725'\n```\n\nTo evaluate numerical and date or time property values, use relational filter operators like this:\n\n```http\nGET /hardware?lastModified=gt:'2021-11-25'\n```\n\nTo match part of a string property value, use match filter operators like this:\n\n```http\nGET /hardware?model=contains:'axis'\n```\n\nAvailable filter operators:\n\n- `lt` less than\n- `gt` greater than\n- `notEquals` not equals\n- `startsWith` string starts with\n- `contains` string that contains\n\n#### Pagination\n\nTo limit the amount of data returned, add these query parameters to the resource URI:\n\n- `page=<number>`\n- `size=<number>`\n\nPagination is available for collection resource URIs. For example, to get the first 10 hardware objects:\n\n```http\nGET /hardware?page=0&size=10\n```\n\n<a id=\"operations-on-objects\"></a>\n## Operations on objects\n\nFor basic configuration objects like `hardware` and `cameras`, the HTTP methods `GET`, `PUT`, `DELETE`, `PATCH`, and `POST` are used to manage these objects. Use of the `POST` may not be possible for some classic VMS objects, as they're created on the server side during discovery or registration.\n\nFor some objects, an entire set of objects are configured in one request – e.g. the `GET` will return an array of objects, and the `PUT` will need to provide a similar set of objects, e.g. when configuring usage of streams. In these cases, the JSON body will contain an array of elements.\n\nFor those resources where just one instance exists, and where there is no specific ID, the ID of the parent is re-used.\n\nHere's a few examples related to cameras. A camera is identified as `/cameras/{camera-id}`, and these camera child resources re-use the parent ID:\n\n- `/streams/{camera-id}`\n- `/motionDetections/{camera-id}`\n- `/settings/{camera-id}`\n\nThese collection objects always exist, the `DELETE` HTTP request isn't supported, and `POST` isn't supported for `motionDetections` and `settings`.\n\nAs a `streams` object is actually an array of streams, these must be updated together. The `POST` method is supported for adding/removing a single stream definition with `task=AddStream` and `task=RemoveStream`, but the `GET`, `PATCH`, and `PUT` methods operate on the entire array of stream definitions in `/streams/{camera-id}`\n\nBy contrast, multiple instances of these camera objects can exist:\n\n- `/cameras/{camera-id}/patrollingProfiles/{profile-id}`\n- `/cameras/{camera-id}/ptzPresets/{preset-id}`\n\nThe `POST` and `DELETE` methods are supported on the respective resource IDs.\n\n### Creating an object\n\nTo create a new object, `POST` the required object properties to the appropriate collection URI like this:\n\n```json\nPOST /analyticsEvents\n\n{\n  \"name\": \"TodaysEvent\"\n}\n```\n\nIf the request is successful, the `analyticsEvent` is created server side, and the response is a `201 OK`. The response body contains the ID of the new object:\n\n```json\nHTTP/1.1 201 Created\n\n{\n    \"result\": {\n        \"id\": \"BCF7FE2B-D124-4639-8390-55E90B1C8B6F\",\n        \"name\": \"TodaysEvent\",\n        \"lastModified\": \"2021-11-30T08:42:57.6241547Z\",\n        \"state\": \"Success\",\n        \"path\": {\n            \"type\": \"analyticsEvent\",\n            \"id\": \"bcf7fe2b-d124-4639-8390-55e90b1c8b6f\"\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\n> Note that the response body contains a `result` object rather than a `data` or `array` object.\n\n### Retrieving object representations\n\nTo retrieve a single hardware configuration:\n\n```http\nGET /hardware/{id}\n```\n\nTo retrieve all hardware on a recording server:\n\n```http\nGET /recordingServers/{id}/hardware\n```\n\nTo retrieve up to 100 of all enabled cameras, using paging:\n\n```http\nGET /cameras?page=0&size=100\n```\n\nTo retrieve up to 100 of all enabled and disabled cameras, using paging:\n\n```http\nGET /cameras?page=0&size=100&disabled\n```\n\n### Updating entire objects\n\nTo update all updatable properties of an object, submit a `PUT` request including (at least) all updatable properties in the request body:\n\n```json\nPUT /hardware/{id}\n\n{\n    // all updateable properties\n}\n```\n\n### Updating parts of an object\n\nTo update some updatable properties of an existing object, submit a `PATCH` request, including just the properties to update in the request body:\n\n```json\nPATCH /hardware/{id}\n\n{\n  \"name\": \"TheNewHardwareName\"\n}\n```\n\n### Deleting an object\n\nTo delete an object, submit a `DELETE` request with no request body:\n\n```http\nDELETE /analyticsEvents/{id}\n```\n\n> **Note**: Some objects can't be deleted\n\n<a id=\"tasks\"></a>\n## Tasks\n\nTasks are used in two general areas:\n\n- For managing details on configuration objects\n- For managing non-configuration objects\n\n### Task invocation\n\nWhen retrieving available tasks for a `recordingServers` object, the response looks like this:\n\n```http\nGET /recordingServers/{id}?tasks\n```\n\n```json\n{\n    \"data\": {\n        // properties for this recording server\n    },\n    \"tasks\": [\n        {\n            \"id\": \"AddHardware\",\n            \"displayName\": \"Add new hardware\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"GetOtherWithMediaOnRecorder\",\n            \"displayName\": \"Get devices with media on recording server\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"HardwareScan\",\n            \"displayName\": \"Detect hardware driver\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"HardwareScanExpress\",\n            \"displayName\": \"Detect hardware\"\n        }\n    ]\n}\n```\n\nThe response above contains an array of tasks available for the object, here the recording server.\n\nTo create a task, the task id is added as a query parameter to the object URI like this:\n\n```http\nPOST /recordingServers/{id}?task=HardwareScan\n```\n\nParameters are supplied in the body of the request.\n\nIf no parameters are given, an error response will contain the minimal JSON content needed. For complex wizard-like editing/validation/creation of, for example, rules and `alarmDefinitions`, there will be a flow of JSON content going back and forth until the entire content can be accepted.\n\nA typical flow will look like this:\n\n1. `POST /recordingServers/{id}?task=HardwareScan`\n2. Response contains the missing parameters (name, description, password)\n3. `POST /recordingServers/{id}?task=HardwareScan` with body of 3 parameters\n4. Response with task id\n5. Loop getting status for `/tasks/{id}`\n6. When successful, `GET` the hardware and update and enable it\n\nThis flow allows you to discover what parameters are used for a given task, and it will also provide a way to be forward-compatible when new parameters are needed.\n\nUse the `POST` HTTP method for all task invocations.\n\nIf the client only submitted this request:\n\n```http\nPOST /recordingServers/{id}?task=HardwareScan\n```\n\nThe response will be a list of the properties to be filled in:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"params\" : {\n      \"recordingServerPath\" : \"recordingServers/<guid>\",\n      \"hardwareAddress\" : \"\",\n      \"userName\" : \"\",\n      \"password\" : \"\",\n      \"hardwareDriverPath\" : \"hardwareDrivers/<guid>\"\n  },\n}\n```\n\nFor some tasks, the response will contain relevant default values or newly added properties.\n\nThe client can then fill in the property values and re-submit the request.\n\nThe response to invoking a task will be an HTTP response of `200 Success`, with a JSON body containing a `task`. When a new object is created, `objectId` is something like `hardware/{id}` for the newly added hardware.\n\n### Task progress and cleanup\n\nFor server-side processing that takes some time, a task request can queue the request and return a task identifier.\n\nFor example, when using the `AddHardware` task, it could look like this:\n\n```json\nPOST /recordingServers/{id}?task=AddHardware\n\n{\n    \"hardwareAddress\": \"10.10.16.90\",\n    \"hardwareDriverPath\": {\n        \"type\": \"hardwareDrivers\",\n        \"id\": \"55f88254-dc3d-4735-acc6-73f21cca2402\"\n    },\n    \"userName\": \"root\",\n    \"password\": \"pass\",\n    \"customData\": \"\"\n}\n```\n\nIf the task is successfully created, the HTTP response code is `201 Created`:\n\n```json\nHTTP/1.1 201 Created\n\n{\n    \"result\": {\n        \"hardwareAddress\": \"10.10.16.90\",\n        \"hardwareDriverPath\": {\n            \"type\": \"hardwareDrivers\",\n            \"id\": \"55f88254-dc3d-4735-acc6-73f21cca2402\"\n        },\n        \"userName\": \"root\",\n        \"password\": \"pass\",\n        \"customData\": \"\",\n        \"state\": \"Idle\",\n        \"path\": {\n            \"type\": \"tasks\",\n            \"id\": \"33\"\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\nTo get an array of current tasks, submit a request like this:\n\n```http\nGET /tasks\n```\n\nThe client can periodically check for the progress and success of a specific task by submitting a request on the provided `/tasks/{id}` path:\n\n```http\nGET /tasks/33\n```\n\nNot all properties in the response body are present at all times. The value of the `progress` property is an estimated percentage of task done. When `progress` is `100`, the `state` property will contain `Success` or `Error`, and the task has completed. If `state` is `Error`, then `errorCode` and `errorText` will contain values.\n\nHere's an example of an error response:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"data\" : {\n        \"displayName\": \"Adding hardware\",\n        \"progress\": 100,\n        \"errorCode\": 60277,\n        \"errorText\": \"VMO60277: Could not add the hardware.\\\\n\\\\nUnable to connect to the recording server while setting up the hardware.\",\n        \"state\": \"Error\",\n        \"relations\": {\n            \"parent\": {\n                \"type\": \"sites\",\n                \"id\": \"c9cef804-e600-4b4b-b5f9-be246bb49133\"\n            },\n        \"self\": {\n                \"type\": \"tasks\",\n                \"id\": \"33\"\n            }\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\nThe `relations` property may contain the resource link to the object that was the result of the entire task operation, such as added hardware.\n\n### Task cleanup\n\nAfter a task has completed, it should be cleaned up.\n\nTask objects have a `TaskCleanup` task:\n\n```http\nGET tasks/33?tasks&noData\n```\n\n```json\n{\n    \"tasks\": [\n        {\n            \"id\": \"TaskCleanup\",\n            \"displayName\": \"Finish\"\n        }\n    ]\n}\n```\n\nTo clean up the task result, submit this request:\n\n```http\nPOST /tasks/33?task=TaskCleanup\n```\n\nAnd the response will be:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"result\": {\n        \"state\": \"Success\"\n    }\n}\n```\n\n## Encoding and formats\n\n### URI path segments and query\n\nWhen building a request URI, use the syntax rules defined in [RFC 3986](#RFC3986) sections 3.3 and 3.4.\n\nIn short, percent-encode the subdelim characters `!$&'()\\*+,;=`.\n\n### JSON data formats\n\nRequest and response body content consists of a JSON object that complies with the syntax rules defined in [Introducing JSON](#JSON), [ECMA-404](#ECMA404), or [RFC 8259](#RFC8259).\n\nIn short:\n\n- String values use UTF-8 encoding and are enclosed in double quotes `\"`. Backslash-escape a double quote within a string like this: `\\\"`.\n- Real numbers use `.` (dot) for decimal point.\n- Date and time values are represented as strings in [ISO 8601](#ISO8601) format in UTC: `yyyy-MM-ddTHH:mm:ssZ`, or\n  `yyyy-MM-ddTHH:mm:ss.fffZ` when microseconds are relevant.  \n  For example: `\"2020-04-02T08:29:58.172Z\"`\n\n## Status and error codes\n\n> Please note that error response samples are generic, that is, not specific for each request.\n\n- `200 OK` – Success: the request completed correctly\n- `201 Created` – Success: an object was created\n- 4xx Client errors – The response body will contain a JSON object that describes one or more errors. Relevant for:\n  - `400 Bad Request`\n  - `401 Unauthorized`\n  - `403 Forbidden`\n  - `404 Not Found`\n- 5xx Server errors – The response body may contain one or more error descriptions\n  - `500 Internal Server Error`\n\nIf a request resource URI or body content is incorrect, the response body will contain the details of the error. Errors could be like:\n\n- Bad resource path\n- Parameter values out of range\n- Client is not authorized for request\n- Requested object not found\n- Operation not possible\n\n\n"

            State group ID. An event type can belong at most to one state group.
            All event types with the same state group ID are used to determine
            the state of a source. A source can be related to more than one
            state group. 

            For example, a camera source is related to at least two state
            groups: The motion state group and the recording state group. Event
            types motion started and stopped in the motion state group determine
            whether something is moving inside the frame. Together, event types
            recording started and stopped in the recording state group determine
            whether the camera stream is being recorded.
